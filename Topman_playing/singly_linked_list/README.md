# C - Singly Linked List
While I'm yet to write a detailed README file, feel free to look around, you may clone the repo, navigate into this directory and just enter the command `make`, and an executable file named `my_list` will be automatically generated from the Makefile; run it and see the result of the codes, reading from the `main.c` file first.

###### THANK YOU
