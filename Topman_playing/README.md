# My `C` Playground
If you had enough courage to come near this zone, congratulations.
I wish you will practice to the point of reproducing all these codes by yourself.
Well, I decided to start saving my own `c` codes (that I write while practicing `c`) on Git as well, so this directory holds such codes.

Indeed *`c` is fun*
