# Cohort 10 and C-programming
![Banner-The_journey_through_C-with_Topman_Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike/rough_work/blob/main/screenshots/Cohort-10_and_C%20(Banner).png)

In a bid to reduce the amount of confusion that people of Cohort 10 were facing while in the first section in the ALX SE program, the founder of **CodeTrybe**, [**Topman Paul-Dike**](https://github.com/tpauldike), who happened to be in Cohort 7 in the program, heavily supported by some voluteers with like-mind, decided to take everyone from the scratch of C programing to bring on board those who are floating as a result of not paying close attention at the earliest stage or getting overwhelmed or not having the opportunity to learn with  peers.

**This repository was created to hold the codes that we wrote in such classes** so that the students can always refer back to them, copy them, and play around with them.
And we began from *what is C?* with the intention of bringing many students to that point where they are able to figure a lot of things out on their own, which is the intention of the program.

The contributors here are the chosen men, who lead the **CodeTrybe** buddy groups and ensure that PLD session hold on the ALX Peer Learning Days, and they do so by putting in much more, which of course makes their life better. They are:
- [Mr. Ambrose](https://github.com/Ambyzhale): **CodeTrybe 10** Group A leader
- [Mr. Soyoye](https://github.com/Odeqku): **CodeTrybe 10** Group B leader
- [Mr. Levi](https://github.com/levoski1): **CodeTrybe 10** Group C leader

And, of course, there were also contributions from the [demo account](https://github.com/codetrybe) created for **CodeTrybe** officials to use in teaching newbies how to use <u>Git and GitHub</u>
