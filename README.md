# Cohort 10 and C-programming
![Banner-The_journey_through_C-with_Topman_Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike/rough_work/blob/main/screenshots/Cohort-10_and_C%20(Banner).png)

In a bid to reduce the amount of confusion that beginner-programmers encounter while learning C programming, the founder of **CodeTrybe**, [**Topman Paul-Dike**](https://github.com/tpauldike), heavily supported by some voluteers with like-mind, decided to take everyone interested in C programming from the scratch, especially those who tried and gave up but still wish to learn it.

**This repository was created to hold the codes that we wrote in such classes** so that the students can always refer back to them, copy them, and play around with them. The intention is to equip learners with the capacity to solve problems with C.

The contributors here are the chosen men, who lead the **CodeTrybe** learning  groups and ensure that learning takes place among their mates. They are:
- [Mr. Ambrose](https://github.com/Ambyzhale): **CodeTrybe 10** Group A leader
- [Mr. Soyoye](https://github.com/Odeqku): **CodeTrybe 10** Group B leader
- [Mr. Levi](https://github.com/levoski1): **CodeTrybe 10** Group C leader

And, of course, there were also contributions from the [demo account](https://github.com/codetrybe) created for **CodeTrybe** officials to use in teaching newbies how to use <u>Git and GitHub</u>
