# `C` struct, typedef
In this class, we learned about:
- primitive data types
- derived data types
- data structures
- abstract data types (ADT)

We tried to appreciate the real world applications of these, we talked about the stack and how that it is the technique behind *undo* and *redo* in computer systems.
We compared arrays and linked list a bit and deviated a little to highlight the main difference between singly linked lists, doubly linked lists and circular linked lists.

## What is struct and typedef?
We established that struct is the data structure in `c` that allows one to group data of different types as one data type, *similar to creating an objects with attributes in python*.
And that `typedef` is simply used to provide an alias for the `struct` created.

We resolved to build a simple struct for each contact in a phonebook and the last thing we did before the end of the class was [this file](./contact.c).

In the file [struct.c](./struct.c), we were trying to prove whether (or not) an array was needed to store the user's number.
You may get the file, compile it, run it and type in a contact to see the result for yourself.
## Assignment
What and what is not right in the file [contact.c](./contact.c) and why?
