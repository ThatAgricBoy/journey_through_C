# Live Coding Session 0
This wasn't the first **Live Coding Session** in the `Journey through C` series, but it was the first one after which we pushed to git the codes we wrote. We actually code live in all of our sessions but this one is different because we come we the sole aim of ***writing programmes and getting some tasks done, with in-depth understanding of the problem and the `algorithm` used to solve it*** while the other sessions not tagged Live Coding is about ***learning and understanding certain concepts basically and practically***

This `README` file is not intended to explain the programs in this directory, as we were just solving problems with the knowledge we had already gained from the previous sessions. This is just to make the codes available for those who were present, who will like to practice or go through them again on their own, and those who might get interested in them at the sight of any of them and to publish the assignment.

###### Note that the executable files had the `.exe` extension because we used a Windows System for this session and Widows automatically adds the extension when you run the `gcc` command.

## Assignment
1. Rewrite anyone of these programs `print_alphabt.c` `print_tebahpla.c` without using `ASCII` values.
2. Rewrite any of them using `while` loop

***Kindly send the screenshots of your source code and the output via WhatsApp to [Topman](https://wa.link/66ef36) directly.***

**The Journey through C** continues. Beware that not all our codes are pushed to git and it is very much better and interesting to be part of the classes. This particular series is as well not recorded.
