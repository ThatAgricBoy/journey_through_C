# `if`, `else` staments and `for loop` in C
This is the summary of a 2-hour peer learning where we tried to practically understand how `if`. `else` and `for loop` works in C programming. We established in the virtual class that `if` `else` is not a type of loop but simply conditional statements in programming.
There are many documents and videos out there that explain all of these in details, so this document is not for the purpose of giving detailed explanation, but to enable many of us (especially those who were in the class) to learn or recall what we know and be inspired to practice on our own.

## How we came about the files here
In this directory are the following files:
- the source codes:
  - if-else.c
  - for-loop.c
- the executables (compiled using `gcc`):
  - 0-welcome
  - 1-welcome
  - 2-welcome
  - loop
